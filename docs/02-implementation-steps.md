# Implementation Steps

This document outlines the process followed to implement the Figma MCP server, from project setup to final testing.

## 1. Project Setup

### Initial Directory Structure

The project was organized with the following structure:
- `/src` for TypeScript source files
- `/config` for configuration files
- `/services` for API integrations
- `/utils` for utility functions
- `/types` for type definitions

### Dependencies Installation

The project uses Bun as its package manager and runtime. Key dependencies include:
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for MCP implementation
- `@figma/rest-api-spec` for Figma API type definitions
- `axios` for HTTP requests
- `zod` for schema validation
- `dotenv` for environment variable management

## 2. Configuration Setup

### Environment Variables

Created a configuration system using Zod to validate environment variables:
- `FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: For Figma API authentication
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

## 3. Figma API Integration

### API Service Implementation

Created a comprehensive service for interacting with the Figma API:
- Used official Figma REST API specification types
- Implemented methods for all required API endpoints
- Added request/response handling with proper error management
- Organized methods by resource type (files, nodes, comments, etc.)

### Utility Functions

Implemented utility functions for common operations:
- Finding nodes by ID
- Getting nodes by type
- Extracting text from nodes
- Formatting node information
- Calculating node paths in document hierarchy

## 4. MCP Server Implementation

### Server Setup

Set up the MCP server using the MCP SDK:
- Configured server metadata (name, version)
- Connected to standard I/O for communication
- Set up error handling and logging

### Tools Implementation

Created tools for various Figma operations:
- `get_file`: Retrieve file information
- `get_node`: Access specific nodes
- `get_comments`: Read file comments
- `get_images`: Export node images
- `get_file_versions`: Access version history
- `search_text`: Search for text in files
- `get_components`: Get file components
- `add_comment`: Add comments to files

Each tool includes:
- Parameter validation using Zod
- Error handling and response formatting
- Proper response formatting for AI consumption

### Resource Templates

Implemented resource templates for consistent access patterns:
- `figma-file://{file_key}`: Access to Figma files
- `figma-node://{file_key}/{node_id}`: Access to specific nodes

## 5. Build System

### Build Configuration

Set up a build system with Bun:
- Configured TypeScript compilation
- Set up build scripts for development and production
- Created a Makefile for common operations

### Scripts

Implemented various scripts:
- `start`: Run the server
- `dev`: Development mode with auto-reload
- `mcp`: MCP server with auto-reload
- `build`: Build the project
- `build:mcp`: Build the MCP server
- `test`: Run tests
- `clean`: Clean build artifacts

## 6. Documentation

### README

Created a comprehensive README with:
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Available tools and resources
- Development guidelines

### Code Documentation

Added documentation throughout the codebase:
- Function and method descriptions
- Parameter documentation
- Type definitions
- Usage examples

## 7. Testing and Verification

### Build Verification

Verified the build process:
- Confirmed successful compilation
- Checked for TypeScript errors
- Ensured all dependencies were properly resolved

### File Structure Verification

Confirmed the final directory structure:
- All required files in place
- Proper organization of code
- Correct file permissions

## Next Steps

- **Integration Testing**: Test with real AI assistants
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for response time
- **Caching**: Add caching for frequent requests
- **Extended Capabilities**: Add more tools and resources
- **User Documentation**: Create end-user documentation
